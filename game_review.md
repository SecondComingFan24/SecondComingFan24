# Game Review time!

For the last few days you probably noticed I've been playing games on itch.io and not uploading. ^^'

Well, I'M STIL DOING THAT \(>▽<)/

And I've completed my third game this week! :3 (most of these games only took a few hours to finish)


The games I played were:

▸ _Dweller's Empty Path_

▸ _Red Trees_

▸ _WIRELAND_

I really liked all of them, but the one I played today had an **EPIC BATTLE SYSTEM** \*w*

Oh, you probably wanna hear about the others too so here goes.

## DWELLER'S EMPTY PATH

This game didn't really have much of a goal here, persay.

Your vessel <sub>(that's what I call them now, haha. 0-0')</sub> has a nightmare, and decides to go for a stroll to relax, and take her mind off things.

More info on the download page, not much else to say. But hey, it comes with a complementary map so you don't get lost :D 


Oh, and did I mention, everything is green over here? Remember to look at colorful things every now and then to not feel dizzy! (then on the other hand you will feel dizzy looking at all those colors, maybe.)


However, there isn't really a battle system. It's just cutscenes. Sorry to spoil it for you U.U

## RED TREES

Unlike Dweller's Empty Path, Red Trees is limited to the colors of Red, Yellow, Purple, Black and White instead of just green. And also unlike Dweller's Empty Path, they are all limited to just one shade of that specific color, whereas DwEmP has multiple shades of green.
(I mean, how would you be able to make anything out if you keep it in the same shade of green for everything, it would just be a giant green rectangle.)

Alright. Enough about color palletes, time to talk about story.


In Red Trees, your vessel is just going about her day when she sees that the forest, for some reason, is off limits today. It seemed that something was afoot in the forest, and every one would have to stay at the town, for their safety. Your goal is to check out _what_ is lurking in the forest and stop it.

As for Battles, you don't actually encounter anyone to fight with. So there isn't any need for a battle system.


## WIRELAND
WIRELAND doesn't have one thing the other two has. COLOR LIMITATIONS. No limits. Any shade, Any hue. This one passes with flying colors. Haha, get it? Wink wink? Alright sorry, back to the point.


_EITHER WAY STORY TIME_

Your vessel wakes up to a surprise, HIS GF IS MISSING, **OH NOOOOO**- also this is the only game in this list with a male protagonist. Anyways where was I, oh yes, **-OOOOO** WHAT DO WE DO?!!!

he later finds his GF's spirit trapped in a toilet. 

Now he needs to find his GF's body in the legendary land of WIRELAND where everyone is Wire. His GF's name is Wire btw. EVERYONE THERE IS HIS GF. but not actually his GF. They're all AUs!!! :D And they're also all single! :◖

This is also the only game with a Battle System, btw. And boy it was cool! I FRICKIN LOVED IT.

 I'm now trying to exploit it and make it into a battle engine >:3
 
And that's it guys!

Be sure to check out all these games!
